        <h3>Who we are</h3>
        <p class="align-justified">Our company was founded in 1981 by former Microsoft employees Greg Nicoleson and Mike Thomas. Our debut product, the arcade game Ratman (1982), was a critical and commercial success; with its realism, written sequences and seamless storytelling, it had a lasting influence on the arcade genre. Followed by Legend of Zrolda in 1992, with advanced physics systems and an increased focus on story and characters, Legend of Zrolda received critical acclaim and sold 12 million copies by 2001. Nicoleson sadly left in 2005. In 2007, our company released the multiplayer online battlefield game Call of Battlefield. In 2021, we have decided to launch Vapour to keep our older games from becoming abandonware.</p>

        <h3>Why we do it?</h3>
        <p class="align-justified">In our rapidly moving world, sadly games are bound to be unavaliable over time.<br>To counter this issue we have decided to make our older games avaliable to everyone for completely free since we would not really get any more profit from them anyways.<br>This solution pleases both us and our dearly valued fanbase. They get to play with the games they grew up with, and we get to enjoy the thought that our games still live on.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">Our company's structure</h3>
        <p class="text-center align-justified pb-3">Initially, we used a hierarchical structure more typical of other development companies, driven by the nature of physical game releases through publishers that required tasks to be completed by deadlines. However, later on, it was found that the hierarchical structure was hampering progress. After completing Legend of Zrolda, we switched to a flat organization; outside of executives, we have no bosses, and use an open allocation system. This approach allows employees to work on whatever interests them, but requires them to take ownership of their product and mistakes they can make.</p>
